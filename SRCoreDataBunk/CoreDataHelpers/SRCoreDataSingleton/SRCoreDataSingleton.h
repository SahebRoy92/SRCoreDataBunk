        THE PURPOSE OF THIS CLASS IS TO TAKE AWAY THE BIOLERPLATE CODE IN APP DELEGATE 
        AND THIS CLASS ACTS AS A WRAPPER AND CONTAINS THE CORE DATA STACK.
        
        THIS CLASS ALSO HAS LIGHTWEIGHT MIGRATION IMPLEMENTED INTO IT.
 
        AND WONT CRASH/ABORT WHEN THE PERSISTANT STORE COORDINATOR FAILS TO LOAD THE STORE
        AS IT WILL CREATE A NEW PSC AND MOVE THE OLDER ONE IN A SAFE LOCATION WITHOUT TAMPERING THE DATA
